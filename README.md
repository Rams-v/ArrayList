3 Even-Odd Array Separator
This Java program allows users to input numbers and separates them into two arrays named 'even' and 'odd' based on whether they are even or odd.

## How to Use
Compile the Java file (EvenOddArraySeparator.java).
Run the compiled program.
Enter the numbers when prompted.
The program will separate the numbers into two arrays: 'even' for even numbers and 'odd' for odd numbers.
The separated arrays will be displayed to the user.

## Note
Ensure that the input provided by the user is valid (i.e., numeric).
Handle any potential exceptions or errors gracefully.
